## Requirements Engineering


### 1.List and discuss major drawbacks of using natural language for specifying requirements.
(1)Natural language description requires it's readers to know a lot of tacit knowledge. If not, it's hard for readers to totally understand the description.  
(2)In practice the natural language description may be out of date, like software documentation, their validity tends to deteriorate with time.
    In this way, natural language descriptions are always used at the beginning of the objective-oriented analysis.

### 2. For an office information system, identify different types of stakeholders. Can you think of ways in which the requirements of these stakeholders might conflict?
(1)The stakeholder of the information system may include 
    the boss who pay for the system, 
    manager and employee  who use the system for their daily work.

(2)For the boss or the employer, they may concern about the cost and effect of the system, in other words their main requirement is a system which can improve the productivity with an affordable price.
    For the managers, they don't care how much the system cost, all they concern about is the productivity, or to say the KPI of the employee in the department.
    For the employee, their main requirement for the system is convenience. The office information system may simplify their working process and do some easy jobs automatically. They don't care about the price or the 
    overall KPI.

### 3. Discuss pros and cons of the following descriptive means for a requirements specification: full natural language, constrained natural language, a pictorial language like UML.
(1)Full natural language: More easier for users to describe their needs, because users are more familiar
with natural language. Also it is  is very readable and understandable to the user and other non-professionals involved. 
On the other hand, it's relatively hard for developer to understand the requirement, considering that the natural language 
may be ambiguous and misleading, so it will take more time to negotiate about the requirement.  
(2)Constrained natural language(CNL), with a constrained vocabulary, natural language can be used to specify a more accurate 
requirement. However, the users are required to have some basic knowledge for CNL to determine if the requirement has satisfied 
their real needs.   
(3)Pictorial language, which is a straightforward and accurate method for developers to recognize the requirement.
It will absolutely increase the efficiency, because it allows us to use tools in analyzing the requirements, however, it will obviously spend more time to specify the requirement.

### 4. Which of the descriptive means mentioned in the previous exercise would you favor for describing the requirements of an office automation system? Justify your answers.
In my point of view, what method should be choose depends on the scale and complexity of the project. 
An office automation system is obviously a complex project which may need several teams to work together. So a pictorial language like UML could be better than other means. Because it will ease the requirement management and also make developers thoroughly understand the requirement.
